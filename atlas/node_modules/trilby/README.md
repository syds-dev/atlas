# trilby

A JavaScript chainable collection helper for arrays. Think Underscore or Lodash, but with the intention of being chainable out-of-the-box.

## Support

Trilby makes no apologies for requiring ECMAScript 5 support. For legacy browser support, you'll need to enlist the help of something like [html5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv).

## Installation

Via NPM:

```npm install trilby```

Via Bower:

```bower install trilby```

## Docs

To follow. For now, see the [tests](test/trilby.spec.js) and the [annotated source](trilby.js).
